    <p>Providing crowd sourced information about the current status of foot and cycle routes in areas that are prone to flooding. 
        Current river level data from the Environment Agency is compared against community submitted data to figure out if certain routes are likely to be flooded.
        Please don't take any information from this site as 100% accurate, use it mainly as a handy guide. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If you think the data displayed is not accurate, or a route is missing from the site then please submit feedback via a Github issue, this will help the site improve
        and be more beneficial to other users. <a href="https://github.com/jamescoverdale/IsItFlooded">Github: IsItFlooded</a>
